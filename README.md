# vim-life

Life is a lightweight file explorer, written in pure Vim9 script.
It is capable of browsing and opening files, and performing basic tasks like creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories.

## Installation

Use any of the available plugin managers. For example, [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```
Plug 'hugovandevliert/vim-life'
```

## Getting started

Open a directory:

```
edit .
```

Use `hjkl` to navigate, `-` to go up the directory tree, and `<CR>` to open a file or directory.

For more actions, press `?` to see an overview of all available commands.

## Caveats

This plugin is written for usage by me and those who use [my dotfiles](https://github.com/hugovandevliert/dotfiles).
It has only been tested on MacOS, but should work on most Unix systems.
