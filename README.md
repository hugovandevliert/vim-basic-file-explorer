Life is a <ins>li</ins>ghtweight <ins>f</ins>ile <ins>e</ins>xplorer, written in pure Vim9 script.
It is capable of browsing and opening files, and performing basic tasks like creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories.

This plugin is written for usage by me and those who use [my dotfiles](https://github.com/hugovandevliert/dotfiles).
It has only been tested on MacOS, but should work on most Unix systems.
